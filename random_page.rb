PREFACE


In the following pages I have endeavored to discuss artificial light for
the general reader, in a manner as devoid as possible of intricate
details. The early chapters deal particularly with primitive artificial
light and their contents are generally historical. The science of
light-production may be considered to have been born in the latter part
of the eighteenth century and beginning with that period a few chapters
treat of the development of artificial light up to the present time.
Until the middle of the nineteenth century _mere_ light was available,
but as the century progressed, the light-sources through the application
of science became more powerful and efficient. Gradually _mere_ light
grew to _more_ light and in the dawn of the twentieth century _adequate_
light became available. In a single century, after the development of
artificial light began in earnest, the efficiency of light-production
increased fifty-fold and the cost diminished correspondingly. The next
group of chapters deals with various economic influences of artificial
light and with some of the byways in which artificial light is serving
mankind. On passing through the spectacular aspects of lighting we
finally emerge into the esthetics of light and lighting.

page3: "
The aim has been to show that artificial light has become intricately
interwoven with human activities and that it has been a powerful
influence upon the progress of civilization. The subject is too
extensive to be treated in detail in a single volume, but an effort has
been made to present a discussion fairly complete in scope. It is hoped
that the reader will gain a greater appreciation of artificial light as
an economic factor, as an artistic medium, and as a mighty influence
upon the safety, efficiency, health, happiness, and general progress of
mankind.

ARTIFICIAL LIGHT
I
LIGHT AND PROGRESS

The human race was born in slavery, totally subservient to nature. The
earliest primitive beings feasted or starved according to nature's
bounty and sweltered or shivered according to the weather. When night
fell they sought shelter with animal instinct, for not only were
activities almost completely curtailed by darkness but beyond its screen
lurked many dangers. It is interesting to philosophize upon a
distinction between a human being and the animal just below him in the
scale, but it may serve the present purpose to distinguish the human
being as that animal in whom there is an unquenchable and insatiable
desire for independence. The effort to escape from the bondage of nature
is not solely a human instinct; animals burrow or build retreats through
the instinct of self-preservation. But this instinct in animals is soon
satisfied, whereas in human beings it has been leading ever onward
toward complete emancipation.

The progress of civilization is a long chain of countless achievements
each one of which has increased man's independence. Early man perhaps
did not conceive the idea of fire and then set out to produce it. His
infant mind did not operate in this manner. But when he accidentally
struck a spark, produced fire by friction, or discovered it in some
other manner, he saw its possibility. It is thrilling to picture
primitive man at his first bonfire, enjoying the warmth, or at least
interested in it. But how wonderful it must have become as twilight's
curtain was drawn across the heavens! This controllable fire emitted
_light_. It is easy to imagine primitive man pondering over this
phenomenon with his sluggish mind. Doubtless he cautiously picked up a
flaming stick and timidly explored the crowding darkness. Perhaps he
carried it into his cave and behold! night had retreated from his abode!
No longer was it necessary for him to retire to his bed of leaves when
daylight failed. The fire not only banished the chill of night but was a
power over darkness. Viewed from the standpoint of civilization, its
discovery was one of the greatest strides along the highway of human
progress. The activities of man were no longer bounded by sunrise and
sunset. The march of civilization had begun.
",
page6:"
In the present age of abundant artificial light, with its manifold
light-sources and accessories which have made possible countless
applications of light, mankind does not realize the importance of this
comfort. Its wonderful convenience and omnipresence have resulted in
indifference toward it by mankind in general, notwithstanding the fact
that it is essential to man's most important and educative sense. By
extinguishing the light and pondering upon his helplessness in the
resulting darkness, man may gain an idea of its overwhelming importance.
Those unfortunate persons who suffer the terrible calamity of blindness
after years of dependence upon sight will testify in heartrending terms
to the importance of light. Milton, whose eyesight had failed, laments,

    O first created beam and thou great Word
    \"Let there be light,\" and light was over all,
    Why am I thus bereaved thy prime decree?

Perhaps only through a similar loss would one fully appreciate the
tremendous importance of light to him, but imagination should be capable
of convincing him that it is one of the most essential and
pleasure-giving phenomena known to mankind.

A retrospective view down the vista of centuries reveals by contrast the
complexity with which artificial light is woven into human activities of
the present time. Written history fails long before the primitive races
are reached, but it is safe to trust the imagination to penetrate the
fog of unwritten history and find early man huddled in his cave as
daylight wanes. Impelled by the restless spirit of progress, this
primitive being grasped the opportunity which fire afforded to extend
his activities beyond the boundaries of daylight. The crude art upon the
walls of his cave was executed by the flame of a smoking fagot. The fire
on the ledge at the entrance to his abode became a symbol of home, as
the fire on the hearth has symbolized home and hospitality throughout
succeeding ages. The accompanying light and the protection from cold
combined to establish the home circle. The ties of mated animals
expanded through these influences to the bonds of family. Thus light was
woven early into family life and has been throughout the ages a
moralizing and civilizing influence. To-day the residence functions as a
home mainly under artificial light, for owing to the conditions of
living and working, the family group gathers chiefly after daylight has
failed.

From the pine knot of primitive man to the wonderfully convenient
light-sources of to-day there is a great interval, consisting, as
appears retrospectively, of small and simple steps long periods apart.
Measured by present standards and achievements, development was slow at
first and modern man may be inclined to impatience as he views the
history of light and human progress. But the achievements of early
centuries, which appear so simple at the present time, were really great
accomplishments when considered in the light of the knowledge of those
remote periods. Science as it exists to-day is founded upon proved
facts. The scientist, equipped with a knowledge of physical and chemical
laws, is led by his imagination into the darkness of the unexplored
unknown. This knowledge illuminates the pathway so that hypotheses are
intelligently formed. These evolve into theories which are gradually
altered to fit the accumulating facts, for along the battle area of
progress there are innumerable scouting-parties gaining secrets from
nature. These are supported by individuals and by groups, who verify,
amplify, and organize the facts, and they in turn are followed by
inventors who apply them. Liaison is maintained at all points, but the
attack varies from time to time. It may be intense at certain places and
other sectors may be quiet for a time. There are occasional reverses,
but the whole line in general progresses. Each year witnesses the
acquirement of new territory. It is seen that through the centuries
there is an ever-growing momentum as knowledge, efficiency, and
organization increase the strength of this invading army of scientists
and inventors.

The burning fagot rescued mankind from the shackles of darkness, and the
grease-lamp and tallow-candle have done their part. Progress was slow in
those early centuries because the great minds of those ages
philosophized without a basis of established facts: scientific progress
resulted more from an accumulation of accidental discoveries than by a
directed attack of philosophy supported by the facts established by
experiment. It was not until comparatively recent times, at most three
centuries ago, that the great intellects turned to systematically
organized scientific research. Such men as Newton laid the foundation
for the tremendous strides of to-day. The store of facts increased and
as the attitude changed from philosophizing to investigating, the
organized knowledge grew apace. All of this paved the way for the
momentous successes of the present time.
",
page8:"

The end is not in sight and perhaps never will be. The unexplored region
extends to infinity and, judged by the past, the momentum of discovery
will continue to increase for ages to come, unless the human race decays
through the comfort and ease gained from utilizing the magic secrets
which are constantly being wrested from nature. Among the achievements
of science and invention, the production and application of artificial
light ranks high. As an influence upon civilization, no single
achievement surpasses it.

Without artificial light, mankind would be comparatively inactive about
one half its lifetime. To-day it has been fairly well established that
the human organism can flourish on eight hours' sleep in a period of
twenty-four hours. Another eight hours spent in work should settle man's
obligation to the world. The remaining hours should be his own.
Artificial light has made such a distribution of time possible. The
working-periods in many cases may be arranged in the interests of
economy, which often means continuous operations. The sun need not be
considered when these operations are confined to interiors or localized
outdoors.

Thus, artificial light has been an important factor in the great
industrial development of the present time. Man now burrows into the
earth, navigates under water, travels upon the surface of land and sea,
and soars among the clouds piloted by light of his own making. Progress
does not halt at sunset but continues twenty-four hours each day.
Building, printing, manufacturing, commerce, and other activities are
prosecuted continuously, the working-shifts changing at certain periods
regardless of the rising or setting sun. Adequate artificial lighting
decreases spoilage, increases production, and is a powerful factor in
the prevention of industrial accidents.

It has ever been true since the advent of artificial light that the
intellect has been largely nourished after the completion of the day's
work. The highly developed artificial lighting of the present time may
account for much of the vast industry of publication. Books, magazines,
and newspapers owe much to convenient and inexpensive artificial light,
for without it fewer hours would be available for recreation and
advancement through reading. Schools, libraries, and art museums may be
attended at night for the betterment of the human race. The immortal
Lincoln, it is said, gained his early education largely by the light of
the fireplace. But all were not endowed with the persistence of Lincoln,
so that illiteracy was more common in his day than in the present age of
adequate illumination.
",

The theatrical stage not only depends for its effectiveness upon
artificial light but owes its existence and development largely to this
agency. In the moving-picture theater, pictures are projected upon the
screen by means of it and even the production of the pictures is
independent of daylight. These and a vast number of recreational
activities owe much, and in some cases their existence, to artificial
light.

Not many centuries ago the streets at night were overrun by thieves and
to venture outdoors after dark was to court robbery and even bodily
harm. In these days of comparative safety it is difficult to realize the
influence that abundant illumination has had in increasing the safety of
life and property. Maeterlinck in his poetical drama, \"The Bluebird,\"
appropriately has made _Light_ the faithful companion of mankind. The
Palace of Night, into which _Light_ is not permitted to enter, is the
abode of many evils. Thus the poet has played upon the primitive
instincts of the impressiveness of light and darkness.

By combining the symbolism of light, color, and darkness with the
instincts which have been inherited by mankind from its superstitious
ancestry of the age of mythology, another field of application of
artificial light is opened. Light has gradually assumed such attributes
as truth, knowledge, progress, enlightenment. Throughout the early ages
light was more or less worshiped and thus artificial lights became woven
in many religious ceremonies. Some of these have persisted to the
present time. The great pageants of peace celebrations and world's
expositions appropriately feature artificial light. In drawing upon the
potentiality of the expressiveness and impressiveness of light and
color, artificial light is playing a major part. Doubtless the future
generations will be entertained by gorgeous symphonies of light.
Experiments are performed in this direction now and then, and it is
reasonable to expect that after many centuries of cultivation of the
appreciation of light-symphonies, these will take a place among the
arts. The elaborate and complicated music of the present time is
appreciated by civilized nations only after many centuries of slow
cultivation of taste and understanding.

Light-therapy is to-day a distinct science and art. The germicidal
action of light-rays and of some of the invisible rays which ordinarily
accompany the luminous rays is well proved. Wounds are treated
effectively and water is sterilized by the ultraviolet radiant energy in
modern artificial illuminants.

Thousands of lighthouses, light-ships, and light-buoys are scattered
along sea-coasts, rivers, and channels. They guide the wheelman and warn
the lookout of shoals and reefs. Some of these send forth flashes of
light whose intensities are measured in millions of candle-power. Many
are unattended for days and even months. These powerful lights dominated
by automatic mechanisms have replaced the wood-fires which were
maintained a few centuries ago upon certain prominent points.

Signal-lights now guide the railroad train through the night. A burning
flare dropped from the rear of a train keeps the following train at a
safe distance. Huge search-lights penetrate the night air for many
miles. When these are equipped with shutters, a code may be flashed from
one ship to another or between the vessel and land. A code from a
powerful search-light has been read a hundred miles away because the
flashes were projected upon a layer of high clouds and were thus visible
far beyond the horizon.

Artificial light played its part in the recent war. Huge search-light
equipments were devised for portability. This mobile apparatus was
utilized against enemy aircraft and in various other ways. Small
hand-lamps are used to send out a pencil of light as directed by a pair
of sights and the code is flashed by means of a trigger. Raiding-parties
are no longer concealed by the curtain of darkness, for rockets and
star-shells are used to illuminate large areas. Flares sent upward to
drift slowly downward supported by parachutes saved and cost many lives
during the recent war. Rockets are used by ships in distress and also by
beleaguered troops.

Experiments are being prosecuted to ascertain the possibilities of
artificial light in the forcing of plant-growth, and even chickens are
made to work longer hours by its use.
